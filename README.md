# odin-recipes
Have a basic recipe website, including all the current knowledge I have on HTML:

This will contain:
- Setting up pages.
- Having a well organized file structure
- Putting in Text (headlines/strong and em marked)
- Putting in Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Including hyperlinks (related and absolute)
- Including pictures

Besides that the project will be shared through git on GitHub so I learn how to work with Git.
